CC3100 SDK v1.0.0 release
================================================================================

The CC3100 SDK contains drivers, many sample applications for Wi-Fi features and
internet, and documentation needed to use the CC3100 Internet-on-a-chip™ solution.
This SDK can be used with TI’s MSP-EXP430F5529LP LaunchPad or SimpleLink Studio, 
a PC tool that allows MCU development with CC3100. You can also use the SDK as 
example code for any platform.  All sample applications in the SDK are supported 
on TI’s MSP430F5529 ultra-low-power MCU with Code Composer Studio IDE and no RTOS.
In addition, some of the applications support IAR as well
